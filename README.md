This study employs a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between years of experience and salary using a dataset from the YBI Foundation. The model shows a strong positive correlation, with each additional year of experience predicting a salary increase of approximately 9444 units. Model performance metrics—MAE ≈ 2877.53, MAPE ≈ 5.92%, and MSE ≈ 12.35 million—indicate high predictive accuracy. The findings confirm a statistically significant linear relationship, making this model useful for salary forecasting in domains like HR analytics. Future improvements could involve incorporating more features or exploring non-linear modeling approaches.
